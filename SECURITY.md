# Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the F1 Race Countdown Bot.

## ‚úÖ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. No Hardcoded Credentials
- All API keys and tokens are stored in environment variables
- No credentials are hardcoded in the source code
- Template files use placeholder values

### 2. Secure Configuration
- `config.ini.template` provides a safe template
- `env_example.txt` shows the required environment variables
- Users must create their own `.env` file with actual credentials

### 3. Gitignore Protection
- `.env` file is excluded from version control
- `config.ini` file is excluded from version control
- Log files are excluded to prevent credential leakage
- Cache directories are excluded

### 4. Interactive Setup
- `setup_discord.py` prompts users for their own webhook URLs
- No hardcoded webhook URLs in the codebase
- Users must provide their own Discord webhook URLs

### 5. Environment Variable Usage
- Twitter API credentials loaded from environment variables
- Discord webhook URLs loaded from environment variables
- No credential storage in configuration files

## üîí Security Best Practices for Users

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Create .env file with your credentials
cp env_example.txt .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

### 2. Never Commit Sensitive Files
- Never commit `.env` file
- Never commit `config.ini` file (if it contains credentials)
- Never commit log files

### 3. Use Template Files
- Use `config.ini.template` as a base for your configuration
- Use `env_example.txt` as a template for your environment variables

### 4. Regular Security Checks
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor your Twitter API usage
- Check for any unauthorized access

## üö® What to Do If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediately revoke compromised credentials**
   - Go to Twitter Developer Portal
   - Regenerate API keys and tokens
   - Update your `.env` file

2. **Check for unauthorized usage**
   - Review your Twitter API usage logs
   - Check for any unauthorized tweets

3. **Update all instances**
   - Update credentials on all deployment servers
   - Update any backup configurations

## üìã Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] `.env` file is created with your credentials
- [ ] `.env` file is not committed to version control
- [ ] `config.ini` file is created from template
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in any files
- [ ] Discord webhooks are your own (if used)
- [ ] Log files are excluded from version control
- [ ] Cache directories are excluded from version control

## üîç Security Monitoring

The bot includes several security features:
- Error logging without exposing credentials
- Debug mode for testing without posting tweets
- Environment variable validation
- Secure credential loading

## üìû Security Support

If you discover any security issues:
1. **Do not** post credentials in issues
2. **Do not** commit credentials to the repository
3. Report security issues privately to the maintainer
4. Follow responsible disclosure practices
