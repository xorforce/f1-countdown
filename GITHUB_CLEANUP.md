# GitHub Repository Cleanup Guide

## ✅ Sensitive Data Removal Complete

The repository has been successfully cleaned using `git-filter-repo`. All sensitive data has been removed from the entire Git history.

### What Was Removed

1. **config.ini file** - Completely removed from all commits in history
2. **Sensitive patterns** - All Twitter API credentials and Discord webhook URLs
3. **Log files** - Any log files containing sensitive information

### Current State

- ✅ No sensitive data in current files
- ✅ No sensitive data in Git history
- ✅ Repository is ready for public use
- ✅ All branches cleaned
- ✅ Complete history rewritten

## 🚀 Pushing to GitHub

### Step 1: Force Push to GitHub

Since the Git history has been rewritten, you need to force push to update GitHub:

```bash
# Add the origin remote back (it was removed by git-filter-repo)
git remote add origin git@github.com:xorforce/f1-countdown.git

# Force push to overwrite the remote repository
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify the Cleanup

After pushing, verify that:
1. The repository on GitHub no longer contains sensitive data
2. All branches are updated
3. The history is clean

### Step 3: Update Collaborators

If anyone else has cloned the repository, they will need to:

```bash
# Remove the old repository
rm -rf F1-script

# Clone the cleaned repository
git clone git@github.com:xorforce/f1-countdown.git F1-script
```

## 🔒 Security Verification

The repository is now secure with:

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Environment variable-based configuration
- ✅ Template files for setup
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore
- ✅ Clean Git history
- ✅ Security documentation
